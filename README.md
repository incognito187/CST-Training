* Contact-based workflows:

These workflows automate actions based on your contacts' behavior, allowing you to personalize communications. 
For example, you can send automated follow-ups to contacts who haven't opened an email in 30 days, 
enroll new subscribers in onboarding email sequences, and add contacts to segments based on their preferences. 

* Deal-based workflows:

Trigger actions like Slack notifications or follow-up tasks when deal properties are updated. 
This provides real-time visibility into deal milestones and changes, ensuring timely follow-up. 

* Company-based workflows:

Automate actions based on company records, such as sending annual review requests or triggering 
specific communications based on company size or industry. 

* Ticket-based workflows:

Help customer service teams manage issues seamlessly by updating priority, assignment, 
and status as issues move from open to closed. 

* Quote-based workflows: 

Trigger notifications at specific milestones, 
like 5 days before the expiration date, and automate sending discount approvals to ensure 
proper oversight of pricing. 

* Third-party app workflows: 

Tools like Luru can extend beyond the native capabilities of 
HubSpot to create multi-step workflows that integrate with other applications.
